# Robotic arm
### An ESP32 based robotic arm to automate simple tasks.
This project consists of the design and development -- hardware and software -- of a precise robotic arm for general automation tasks. The project is in the early stages of development. The main features that are supposed to include are:
- Precise robot with 4 degrees of freedom and an actuator.
- The actuator must be able to rotate indefinetely.
- The actuator must be reemplazable for different functions.
